## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to review the bike sharing program currently in place in NYC to determine trends and how best to go about starting a bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Results
Please refer to 7 visualizations located [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/R5ZK5G9FZ?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
- Observations are made for each tab in order.  We can draw the following conclusions from the data analysed: 
1. 65% of the riders using the Bike sharing program in New York City identify as males.
2. Most rides taken have a duration of less than 30 minutes (with a peak around 5 minutes per ride). 
3. Short bike rides are a common trend for male and female users alike. 
4. "Rush hour" trips are most common, with users taking trips between 6am and 10am, and between 4pm and 9pm during the week.  
- There is also a strong trend to use the bike sharing program on Thursdays.
5. The rush hour tend also persists for both male and female riders
- This strongly suggests when marketing the bike sharing program; no specific advertising campaigns need to be directed at male and female users separately, however, campaigns can still have a strong presence on male dominated platforms (ie: gaming and sports websites).
6. There is a strong recurring user base (subscribers); indicating that a rewards program or subscription program would also be beneficial to implement in Des Moines. 
7. There is little usage between 1am and 5am during the week (Sunday morning usage is a little higher).  This suggests maintenance and/or bike rotation should occur during these off-peak times. 

## Summary
Based on the data provided regarding the bike sharing program in New York City, a similar program can be implemented in Des Moines. 
In order to do so, we can make the following suggestions: 
We should focus on setting up starting and ending locations in the downtown core with focus on short trips during the rush hour commute (ie: residential districts to places of employment and vice versa).
We should target the program towards males born between 1980 and 1995. (See below for details)
We should offer a subscription-based service to incentivize users. 

### Age demographic breakdown
1. There's a strong user base for clients born between 1980 and 1995.
- Please note: there is an anomaly in the data that strongly suggests a number of users found it amusing to use the birth year of 1969. Only 20% of users born in 1969 are subscribers. The 3rd and 4th tab really help to visualize this anomaly.
