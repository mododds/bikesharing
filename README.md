## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to review the bike sharing program currently in place in NYC to determine trends and how best to go about starting a bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Results
Please refer to 7 visualizations located [here:](https://public.tableau.com/shared/R5ZK5G9FZ?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
- Observations are made for each tab in order.  We can draw the following conclusions from the data analysed: 
1. [Gender Distribution:](https://public.tableau.com/shared/7XKQ9XCNX?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
65% of the riders using the Bike sharing program in New York City identify as males.
2. [Trip Duration:](https://public.tableau.com/shared/27KQ25XCN?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) 
Most rides taken have a duration of less than 30 minutes (with a peak around 5 minutes per ride). 
3. [Trip Duration by Gender:](https://public.tableau.com/shared/DB2T7ZF3M?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
Short bike rides are a common trend for male and female users alike. 
4. [Weekday Trips by Hour:](https://public.tableau.com/shared/XNYK38922?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
"Rush hour" trips are most common, with users taking trips between 6am and 10am, and between 4pm and 9pm during the week.  
- There is also a strong trend to use the bike sharing program on Thursdays.
5. [Hourly Weekday Trips by Gender:](https://public.tableau.com/shared/8S4QFM625?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
The rush hour tend also persists for both male and female riders
- This strongly suggests when marketing the bike sharing program; no specific advertising campaigns need to be directed at male and female users separately, however, campaigns can still have a strong presence on male dominated platforms (ie: gaming and sports websites).
6. [User Trips by Gender:](https://public.tableau.com/shared/452FJJQXX?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
There is a strong recurring user base (subscribers); indicating that a rewards program or subscription program would also be beneficial to implement in Des Moines. 
7. [Number of Trips per Hour:](https://public.tableau.com/shared/ZQ658J5FD?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
There is little usage between 1am and 5am during the week (Sunday morning usage is a little higher).  This suggests maintenance and/or bike rotation should occur during these off-peak times. 

## Summary
Based on the data provided regarding the bike sharing program in New York City, a similar program can be implemented in Des Moines. 
In order to do so, we can make the following suggestions: 
- We should focus on setting up starting and ending locations in the downtown core with focus on short trips during the rush hour commute (ie: residential districts to places of employment and vice versa). Please refer to the [starting](https://public.tableau.com/shared/NDW4CCDZM?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) and [ending](https://public.tableau.com/shared/9KKZS4Y52?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) locations for New York.
- We should target the program towards males born between 1980 and 1995. (See [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/T4HFNWNNH?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) for birth year distribution.)
- We should offer a subscription-based service to incentivize users. 

### Age demographic breakdown & anomalies
1. There's a strong user base for clients born between 1980 and 1995.
- Please note: there is an anomaly in the data that strongly suggests a number of users found it amusing to use the birth year of 1969. Only 20% of users born in 1969 are subscribers. The 3rd and 4th tab really help to visualize this anomaly.
